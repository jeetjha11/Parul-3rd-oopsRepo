java is object oriented programing language

basic syntax:
    public class ClassName
    {
        public static void main(String [] args)
        {
          // code
        }
    }

    ex:
    public class Hello
    {
        public static void main(String [] args)
        {
            // print
            System.out.println("Hello World!!")
        }
    }

    Rule: In case of java the file name and the class name should be
          same:
          How you will save the above class??
          Hello.java




    here public is access modifier
    class is keyword
    class is a user define data type:
    Class first latter should be capital
    Java follows the camel case
    ex:
        suppose there is a class named as
        print book

        Printbook----> class PrintBook


    Steps for running a java program on notepad:
    1> create a java file write the code
    2> save the java file
    3> Go the file location and open the cmd:
    4> Compile the java code:
        javac ClassName.java--> javac Hello.java
        it is generating a another .class file from the resource file
        Hello.java--------->  Hello.class
        Note:
            this class file contains the byte code which is executable for
            all os.

        Here javac is a inbuilt compiler given by jdk


    5> Run the byte code file:
        java ClassName--> java Hello


    Variables:
    It is a container/memory location name/reference which is used to store the data
    into the memory
    syntax:
        dataType variableName=variableValue;
        ex:
        String name="Sita";
        String lastName="Devi";
        Note:  variableName should be always start with small latter


    Data Type:
        1> Primitive--> which is previously defined
            ex: int,float,char,double,short,long,boolean
        2> Non-Primitive--> it is defined by user
            ex:
                Array, Class, String

    Scanner:
       It is a predefined class which is used to take the input from the user at runtime of
       program

       Steps for use Scanner class:
       1-> import th Scanner class
        import java.util.Scanner;
        import-> is a keyword used for import the class
        java->   It is a Library(The collection of Packages)
        util->   It is a Package(The collection of Classes)


       2-> We have to create an object for the Scanner Class:

            Syntax for creating an object:
                ClassName Objectname=new ClassName();
                Hello  h=new Hello();


          Scanner abc=new Scanner(System.in);
       3-> Take input:
            int type of value:
                int a=abc.nextInt();
                float f=abc.nextFloat();
                String name=abc.next()/ abc.nextLine();
                double d=abc.nextDouble();
