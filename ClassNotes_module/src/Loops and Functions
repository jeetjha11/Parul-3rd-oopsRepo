loops:
    It is used to iterate through the same code again
    and again till the condition is satisfied

    Types of loop:
        1-> for() loop:
            Syntax of for loop:
                for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
                {
                    // loop code
                }
                ->here initialization is to initialize the value for a
                variable
                ->condition-> according to the condition the loop will
                  start execution once the condition will be false
                  the loop will terminate.
                  increment/decrement-> for changing the value of
                  the used variable

                ex:
                    print 0-10 using for loop:
                        public class LoopDemo
                        {
                            public static void main(String []args)
                            {
                                        1     2
                                for(int i=0;i<=10;i++)   i=11
                                {
                                    System.out.println(i)   0,1,2...9,10
                                }

                                // rest of code
                            }
                            // input-- enter the starting range--23
                            //enter the ending range--28
                            // output: 23,25,27

                        }

                NOTES: in case of for loop we know the number of iterations
                        that's why the for loop is also called as static loop
        2-> while() loop:
            syntax:
                while(condition)
                {
                    //while loop code
                }
                ex:
                    int i=0;
                    while(i<=10)
                    {
                        System.out.println(i+ " ");
                        i++;
                    }

        3-> do()-while() loop
